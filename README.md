# Assignment 1 part 1. For passing grade E-D

This assignment consists of three parts
 * A practice part for writing and running automated test suites and measure coverage.
 * A second practice part for writing tests with a mocking framework
 * An oral exam that you book

Note that the practice parts are mandatory for passing grade but that we examine YOUR knowledge and not only the code. This means it is essential that you practice writing tests yourself, and not only copy or generate a solution to the practice tasks. 

Each practice task is designed to let you learn what you need to pass the examination.


## Practice tasks:
Find the code and practice tasks here
https://github.com/dntoll/1dv609_a1_part_1

 * Fork this repo on GitHub
 * Clone the forked repo to your own computer. 
 * You can make the fork private if you want. 
 * Follow the instructions in the two Markdown files in the root directory.
   * Practice_ write_run_tests.md and Practice_write_mocked_tests.md
 * Select Java or js versions and check their instructions.
 * Ask questions in Slack!

## Examination 

Examinations are booked in a spreadsheet given in a pinned Slack-post. 
 * Each slot is 15 minutes
 * For A1 p1 book one slot a 15 minutes
 * For A1 p2 (higher grade) book two sequential slots ( 30minutes )
 * Students with written permission can book up double amount of sequential slots

If time runs out before a passing grade can be set, a Fail is recorded.

* Disable AI in your editor
* Be prepared to show the results of the two practice tasks.
* Be prepared to run the tests, to measure coverage, and use mocking.
* Be prepared to edit your code.
* Be prepared to answer questions about any part of your code.
* During examination you will write one or more unit test for new a function that you will be given during examination. You should be able to write unit-tests for that function, run the test, measure coverage. You should be able to select "assert method" depending on the type of function to one of the suitable used in practice tasks. 
* During the examination you are also asked a couple of questions related to the practice task and the study material specified.
* You are not allowed to use AI to solve the task during the examination. You may look at the practice tasks during this examination.
